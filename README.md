# Happy
Source code for the Happy app - built for Friday and Saturday nights. Can't find something to watch? Use the built-in Netflix movie API integration to find something that interests you - there's a timer so you don't scroll endlessly, but it's optional. Hungry? Use the built-in Google Maps SDK integration to find some food! Just type what you want.
